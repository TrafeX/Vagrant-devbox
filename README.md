Vagrant template
================
This Vagrant/Puppet template gives you a VirtualBox Machine with:

* Zend Server
* MySQL
* Vhost for your project
* Memcached
* Varnish
* Solr (soon)

These services can be easily configured with the params file.


TODO
====
* Make distro-independent
* Easily configure the amount of memory memcached can use
